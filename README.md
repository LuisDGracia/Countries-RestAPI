# Rest Countries API Challenge
## What I Use

To complete this challenge from [Forontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions)

I has used

* [React](reactjs.org)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com)
* [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
* [Infinite Scroll component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component)

I choose Infinite scroll over other options like react-window because is the one that fit the best to my approach to the solution and the other options needed a big refactor of the code

## Understanding

While developing this challenge I:

* Learned about useHistory hook from react

* Reinforced my knowledge about routing with react, and learned about HashRouter and how it could be implemented to deploy react apps on github pages without having inconvinients about routes
